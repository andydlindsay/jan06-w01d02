## W1D2 The Dev Workflow

## Problem Statement
Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

## Broken Down
- need to be able to read in unlimited number of cli arguments
- go through arguments
- sum the arguments
- store the arguments
- determine if the argument is a whole number
- test for negative numbers
